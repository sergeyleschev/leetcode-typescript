// 2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence
// Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

// Example 1:
// Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// - "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
// - "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
// - "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
// - "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
// Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

// Example 2:
// Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.

// Example 3:
// Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".
 
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000
// 1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30
// words1[i] and words2[j] consists only of lowercase English letters.

type CountingMap = Map<string, number>

function countingToMap(words: string[]): CountingMap {
  const map = new Map<string, number>()

  for (const word of words) {
    if (!map.has(word)) { map.set(word, 0) }
    map.set(word, map.get(word) + 1)
  }
  
  return map
}

function countWords(words1: string[], words2: string[]): number {
  let count: number = 0
  const words1CountMap: CountingMap = countingToMap(words1)
  const words2CountMap: CountingMap = countingToMap(words2)

  for (const key of Array.from(words1CountMap.keys())) {
    if (words1CountMap.get(key) === 1 && words2CountMap.get(key) === 1) { count += 1 }
  }

  return count
