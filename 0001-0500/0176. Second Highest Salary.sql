-- 176. Second Highest Salary
-- Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
-- +----+--------+
-- | Id | Salary |
-- +----+--------+
-- | 1  | 100    |
-- | 2  | 200    |
-- | 3  | 300    |
-- +----+--------+
-- For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
-- +---------------------+
-- | SecondHighestSalary |
-- +---------------------+
-- | 200                 |
-- +---------------------+
-- MySQL query statement below
select
    max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from
    Employee
where
    Salary < (
        select
            max(Salary)
        from
            Employee
    )
