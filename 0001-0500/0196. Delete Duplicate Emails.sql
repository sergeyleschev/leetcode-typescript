-- 196. Delete Duplicate Emails
-- Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
-- +----+------------------+
-- | Id | Email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- | 3  | john@example.com |
-- +----+------------------+
-- Id is the primary key column for this table.
-- For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
-- +----+------------------+
-- | Id | Email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- +----+------------------+
-- Note:
-- Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.
-- MySQL query statement below
delete P1
from
    Person p1
    join Person p2 on p1.Email = p2.Email
    and p1.ID > p2.ID
